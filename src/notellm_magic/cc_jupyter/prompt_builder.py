As a last resort, you may call it multiple times to split up a large code block. You can make at most {max_cells} calls per turn (i.e., in response to each user prompt).
The user will be presented with the code blocks one by one.
If the user executes it and it succeeds, the next code block gets created in a new cell.
If the user executes it and it errors, then the error will get reported, but the chain is broken. Assume that the user does not see the subsequent code.
If the user executes a cell that is not the next code block, then the chain will pause until the proper next code block is executed.

If the user asks you to modify code in the current cell, you may do this by using the {EXECUTE_PYTHON_TOOL_NAME} tool EXACTLY ONCE.
Identifying that the current cell is the target is obvious because the code block is included directly in the user's request itself.

If the user asks you to edit/change/modify code in a DIFFERENT cell, inform them that you do not have that capability.
Instead, suggest that they use `%%cc edit this cell to <requested edits>` at the top of the cell they would like to edit.
Respond ONLY with that suggestion. DO NOT create new cells for the request and DEFINITELY DO NOT use the {EXECUTE_PYTHON_TOOL_NAME} tool."""

Then, you must re-display the captured output. You can only have one _claude_captured_output context. Use this pattern:

```
from IPython.utils.capture import capture_output

# Your plotting/image code here
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

with capture_output() as _claude_captured_output:
    plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4])
    plt.show()
    plt.plot([3, 4, 5, 6])
    plt.show()

for output in _claude_captured_output.outputs:
    display(output)
```

This allows the system to capture any images for you for further processing."""

    system_prompt_tool_usage = f"""For any questions you can answer on your own, DO NOT use {EXECUTE_PYTHON_TOOL_NAME}.
Don't forget that you have other built-in tools like Read. Try responding using your built-in tools first without using {EXECUTE_PYTHON_TOOL_NAME}. Your response does not need to invoke {EXECUTE_PYTHON_TOOL_NAME}.
If you want to explain something to the user, do not put your explanation in {EXECUTE_PYTHON_TOOL_NAME}. Just return regular prose.

Examples:
<basic-example>
    <request>Help me understand what's in the dataframe `my_df`</request>
    This request should use {EXECUTE_PYTHON_TOOL_NAME} to generate the code for inspecting the dataframe.
</basic-example>

<no-python-example>
    <request>Explain how cc_jupyter/magics.py works</request>
    This request should not use {EXECUTE_PYTHON_TOOL_NAME} at all, since it can be fulfilled by reading the file.
</no-python-example>

<plot-example>
    <request>Plot the data in `my_df` and save the images to files</request>
    The generated code should use `with capture_output() as _claude_captured_output` to capture the displayed image.
</plot-example>

IMPORTANT: Do not invoke {EXECUTE_PYTHON_TOOL_NAME} in parallel.
IMPORTANT: Always include a return value or expression at the end of your {EXECUTE_PYTHON_TOOL_NAME} output. Only return values are captured in output cells - print statements are NOT captured.
For example, instead of print(df.head()), use df.head() as the last line.

If <request> is empty, it is because the user wants you to continue from where you left off in the previous messages."""
